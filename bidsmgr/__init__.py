"""bidsmgr — schema-driven BIDS converter, curator, and editor.

Successor to BIDS-Manager v0.2.5 (the package at ``../BIDS-Manager/``).

The single design bet: **the BIDS schema is the engine**, not a check at the
end. Every layer — classification, naming, GUI form generation, validation,
sidecar generation, post-conversion auditing — reads from the same
machine-readable BIDS schema. See ``../architecture.md`` §0–§3.

Layout (architecture.md §12):

* ``schema``     — keystone rules engine (bidsschematools wrapper)
* ``inventory``  — per-modality scanners (DICOM, EEG/MEG raw, physio)
* ``classifier`` — chained classifiers (BidsGuess, mne channel types,
  sequence dict)
* ``planner``    — entity plans + user edits, schema-validated
* ``converter``  — pluggable backends (dcm2niix-direct default)
* ``metadata``   — post-conversion sidecar engine
* ``fixups``     — fieldmap renaming, IntendedFor, derivatives moves
* ``project``    — event-sourced project files + provenance
* ``editor``     — post-conv BIDS browser + viewers (logic, no Qt)
* ``gui``        — the only Qt-coupled subtree (PyQt6, Inspector layout)
* ``workers``    — QThread bridges (no Qt logic in core modules)
* ``cli``        — CLI dispatch entry points

Nothing imports ``gui``; ``gui`` imports everything else.
